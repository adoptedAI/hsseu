5387,Main Barrage,Khanki Headworks Division,LCC East Faisalabad,Faisalabad,2024-2025,Closure,The newly constructed barrage was found to be in satisfactory condition overall though several deficiencies were observed. Many expansion joints at the main barrage's downstream glacis and the canal head regulator were not properly filled with sealant leading to leakage at multiple gates (Gate Nos. 1 6 7 11 13 15 17 18 19 22 23 24 25 29 39 41 43 46 47 49 51 55 56 58 59 60 62 63 and 65 of main barrage). Additionally the leftover cofferdam on the upstream side was not fully removed and significant Bela formation along with silt deposition was noted which may impact hydraulic efficiency and flow distribution. The river approach has narrowed due to these depositions requiring dredging and river training measures. The condition of the impervious floor loose stone apron and inverted filters could not be fully inspected due to flowing water and silt deposition. However sounding results indicated that the downstream side of the barrage is safe despite the presence of silt. Structural concerns were identified in several components of the barrage. The downstream glacis expansion joint sealant was missing at various gates leading to seepage and cracks. Some bay walls exhibited vertical fissures with active leakage while construction joints in several locations had deteriorated into cracks. The silt excluder was operational but had exposed and unsealed expansion joints. The divide wall showed extensive cracking on the downstream right side with noticeable seepage. The fish ladder had leakage from its construction joint indicating potential deterioration. Vertical cracks were found on several piers with extensive leakage at some locations and most deck pier expansion joints lacked sealant increasing vulnerability to water infiltration. The right-side downstream wing wall exhibited displacement due to earth pressure suggesting structural instability. The canal head regulators at Gate Nos. 1 and 6 had exposed expansion joints with missing sealant and stone pitching along the canal banks showed minor displacement indicating potential erosion. The river training structures were assessed revealing that the Left Guide Bank was in satisfactory condition while the Right Guide Bank showed rain-cut pits on the downstream side. The Right Marginal Bund (RMB) exhibited significant erosion between RD 5+000 and RD 7+000 which may compromise its stability if not addressed. Overall the barrage is structurally sound the observed deficiencies in joint sealing cracking seepage and sediment accumulation require timely remedial measures to maintain its long-term functionality and efficiency.,"1.	Expansion Joints be filled with polyurethane or epoxy-based sealants.

2.	To effectively repair cracks and to prevent leakage the following materials and procedures should be adopted based on the type and severity of the cracks.
Epoxy Injection – For structural cracks use low-viscosity epoxy resin (e.g. Sikadur-52) to restore strength and seal leaks.
Polyurethane Grouting – For active water leakage use hydrophobic polyurethane grout (e.g. SikaFix-210 or MasterInject 1315) which expands to seal voids.
Cementitious Grouting – For larger cracks and honeycombed areas use non-shrink cementitious grout (e.g. SikaGrout-214).
Hydrophilic Swelling Sealants – For joints and continuous leakage apply swelling rubber sealants (e.g. Hydrotite or Kryton Krystol).
Surface Waterproofing – Apply crystalline waterproofing coatings (e.g. Xypex or Penetron) to prevent further seepage.
3.	The D/S wing wall should be closely monitored to detect any signs of further displacement at an early stage. Continuous observation and structural assessment should be conducted to ensure stability.
Survey & Alignment Checks:
•	Conduct periodic total station surveys to measure any displacement.
•	Compare with original design alignment to assess movement trends.
 Crack & Joint Monitoring:
•	Inspect existing cracks for width progression and water ingress.
•	Ensure expansion joints are properly sealed to prevent further deterioration.
Instrumentation & Load Monitoring:
•	Install inclinometers or tilt meters to detect movement.
•	Monitor earth pressure variations behind the wing wall.
Preventive Strengthening Measures:
•	If displacement progresses grouting or reinforcement anchoring may be required.
•	Improve backfill compaction and drainage to reduce active earth pressure.

4.	The eroded slope of the Right Guide Bank (RGB) should be repaired and stabilized to prevent further deterioration and ensure structural integrity.",,Satisfactory,Civil,32.402278,73.967888,Closure 2024-2025
